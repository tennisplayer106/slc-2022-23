                <strong>
                Communicator: - I developed the Learner Profile
            Communicator in this academic year because I gave a speech infront of the entirety of MYP. 
            It requires a lot of confidence and better communication skills to address each member of the 
            middle years program and convince them to vote for you 
            due to which this learner profile was developed for me.  </strong>
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
                Knowledgeable: - I developed the learner profile knowledgeable because this year,
                 there were plenty of topics which were new to me which increased my knowledge. 
                 Things such as set theory, functions, etc. in maths or demography in I&S were never broached 
                 upon before which helped me know more about our world, hence developing this learner profile.</strong>

            <h2 class="title">ATL Skills:</h2>

            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
                Research Skills: - I developed the Research ATL Skills because of our 3rd unit in chemistry. We had to work on
                a project based on our unit where we had to deeply research about the impacts of different
                types of pollutants on the environment and society and then suggest solutions to adress the problem.
            This helped me develop the skill as the task required intensive research to find and evaluate better alternatives
        to sources which produce the pollutants.  </strong>
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
                Listening Skills: - I developed the ATL Skill
            Thinking in this academic year because I got the chance to adjudicate it the 3rd edition of the locked heads debate competition hosted by our school
        (more information on that is available in the achievements section). Since adjudicating requires careful
    listening to grade the participating debators and provide constructive feedback, I developed this skill. </strong>
