                <strong>
                English: -  I want to improve my grades in English by enhancing my
                 Vocabulary more to develop my writing skills. I will be doing so by reading/re-reading books and 
                 make a vocabulary list which would consist of new words I come across. 
                 I will then incorporate them in my work so that I get more used to them.  Time I will take is 1 month.  
                 The support I require is from my teacher which would be in the form of giving me feedback so 
                 that I will know whether I am improving or not. </strong>
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
                <strong>
                I&S: -  I want to score better in I&S criterion B.  I will do this by reading and following the strands of 
                criterion B in I&S more carefully and re-attempting previous yearâ€™s SAs and FAs for revision. Time I will take is 1 month. 
                The support I require from my teacher is in the form of giving me feedback so that I

                <strong>
            MFL: -   I want to further increase my fluency in my chosen language in LA (Hindi). I will read in Hindi daily and note down new words 
            from the resources Sunil Sir shares with us. Time I will take is 1 Month.  The support I require from my teacher 
            would be in the form of giving me feedback so that I will know whether I am improving or not. </strong>

                Goal 1: - My Goal is to prepare for the PSAT exam which I must give in the coming months (April). 
                My strategy

                such as YouTube, Khan Academy, and attempt questions shared in the partice papers. Time I will
            take is 1 Month, and I do not require any support.</strong>

                Goal 2: - My goal is to resume my physical fitness which I stopped due to getting sick multiple times in the past.

            not require any support.  </strong>

                <strong>
