                   I became part of the student council for the very first time and secured the position of vice head of service learning. I cleared all three rounds of selection, which were filling the form, interview and the speech infront of the entirety of MYP.  </strong>

                    I adjudicated in the 3rd edition of the pathways locked heads 3.0 debate competition. I had this prestige because I, along with my team called Nyx, won the first 2 editions of the competitions which granted us the honor to adjudicate and grade the participating debators in the 3rd edition of the competition.  </strong>

                <strong>
                   This year I scored really well in the internation english oympiad as my score was 54/60. This was surprising considering that I almost never prepare properly for olympiads which shows the wonders I can
                achieve if I put in more effort and listen to my Mom.   </strong>
